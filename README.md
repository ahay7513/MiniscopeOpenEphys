# MiniscopeOpenEphys

These are a succession of notebooks to extract and synchronise ephys and miniscope data from sleeping mice. 

File 9_Minian_no_interactive.ipynb is a copy paste from Minian project, just without most of the interactive steps. Please refer to Minian project if you are not familiar with it rather than using my notebook that might contain errors.

They are very lame python codes, information is likely missing
